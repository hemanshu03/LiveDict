# LiveDict (Release v1.0.4)

**TTL-based, (optionally) Persistent Python Dictionary with Hook Callbacks**

LiveDict is a secure, extensible, and ephemeral key-value store designed for applications that need in-memory caching with optional persistence and encryption.

## Highlights
* AES-GCM encryption (via `cryptography`) with a deterministic fallback for test environments.
* TTL expiry driven by a heap-based monitor thread for efficient scheduling.
* Optional persistence backends:
  - SQLite (file-backed DB)
  - File-backed object store (per-bucket files)
  - Redis (thin wrapper; requires `redis` package)
* Hook callbacks (`on_access`, `on_expire`) executed safely (sandboxing recommended).
* Pydantic-backed configuration models for clarity and validation.
* Bucket policies and limits to control memory usage and namespaces.

# LiveDict (Release v2.0.0)

LiveDict is a small utility library providing in-memory dictionary-like structures with
synchronous and asynchronous variants, a sandbox module, and flexible storage backends.

**Important changes in v2**
- Cryptography removed: the package no longer performs encryption. Users must provide their own cryptographic handling.
- Sandbox is active: behaves as implemented in `livedict/modules/sandbox.py`.

## Sandbox usage

Review `livedict/modules/sandbox.py` for details. The sandbox module is included and active;
exercise caution and review its behavior before running untrusted code.
